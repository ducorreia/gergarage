                    experience repairing all types of cars, vans and SUV's your vehicle will receive the highest quality
                    workmanship and diligence. We pride ourselves on establishing a high standard in the game for
                    competitive pricing and customer satisfaction.
                    Please feel free to call us if you would like advice on your car, as our mechanics are happy to
                    help. We understand that not everyone has had the time or inclination to research their vehicle. To
                    look for solutions to what may seem like a small problem, ie checking coolant levels and dipping
                    your car for oil, or even pressurising the tyre's. To some these may seem like basic car skills but
                    with todays modern cars it is not always obvious where the levels should be and how they should be
                    checked. So our open door policy invites you in to learn a little more about your vehicle and always
                    understand that no car question is below our expertise.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you</p>
